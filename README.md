# AI Chat UI for OpenAI (Flask + Docker)

This project provides a simple and modern web interface for interacting with OpenAI's GPT models using Flask, JavaScript, and Docker. It includes chat history tracking, dark mode, typing indicators, and chat saving.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Chat UI** – Clean, responsive web interface for chatting with OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Chat History Storage** – Session-based memory so the assistant remembers past messages.
- **Typing Indicator** – Shows when the assistant is "thinking."
- **Dark Mode UI** – Modern, mobile-friendly, and easy on the eyes.
- **Chat Saving** – Save chat logs as timestamped text files.
- **Dockerized Deployment** – Quickly deploy with `docker compose up -d --build`.

NOTE: if running in docker, skip to step 5 as the dependencies will be installed in the docker container.
## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣  Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nick31415926/flask-chatgpt
cd flask-chatgpt
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up OpenAI API Key and Localhost IP
Instead of using a `.env` file, set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable in your OS:
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here  # For Linux/macOS
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here     # For Windows (Command Prompt)
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here" # For Windows (PowerShell)

export LOCALHOST_IP=your-ip-here  # For Linux/macOS
set LOCALHOST_IP=your-ip-here    # For Windows (Command Prompt)
$env:LOCALHOST_IP="your-ip-here" # For Windows (PowerShell)

```
Alternatively, you can manually copy and paste the API key inside the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Set your IP manually in \static\app.js on line 7:

const LOCALHOST_IP = "127.0.0.1"; // Adjust based on your network

## 🐳 Running with Docker

The app is Dockerized, so you can run everything in containers.

### 1️⃣ Build & Run with Docker Compose
```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 2️⃣ Stop the Application
```sh
docker compose down
```

### 3️⃣ Clean Up Old Docker Images
```sh
docker system prune -af
```

## 🤖 Setting your Open AI model

Modify `app.py`:
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",  # Upgrade to GPT-4o for better performance
    messages=session['history']
)
```
Available OpenAI Models:
- gpt-4o – The latest and most advanced model, offering faster response times and improved accuracy.
- gpt-4-turbo – Optimized version of GPT-4, balancing cost and performance.
- gpt-4 – Standard GPT-4 model, providing high-quality responses.
- gpt-3.5-turbo – A more budget-friendly option with good performance.
