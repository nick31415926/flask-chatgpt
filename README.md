## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Chat UI** ‚Äì Clean, responsive web interface for chatting with OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Chat History Storage** ‚Äì Session-based memory so the assistant remembers past messages.
- **Typing Indicator** ‚Äì Shows when the assistant is "thinking."
- **Dark Mode UI** ‚Äì Modern, mobile-friendly, and easy on the eyes.
- **Chat Saving** ‚Äì Save chat logs as timestamped text files.
- **Dockerized Deployment** ‚Äì Quickly deploy with `docker compose up -d --build`.

NOTE: if running in docker, skip to step 5 as the dependencies will be installed in the docker container.
## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£  Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nick31415926/flask-chatgpt
cd flask-chatgpt
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up OpenAI API Key and Localhost IP
Instead of using a `.env` file, set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable in your OS:
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here  # For Linux/macOS
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here     # For Windows (Command Prompt)
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here" # For Windows (PowerShell)

export LOCALHOST_IP=your-ip-here  # For Linux/macOS
set LOCALHOST_IP=your-ip-here    # For Windows (Command Prompt)
$env:LOCALHOST_IP="your-ip-here" # For Windows (PowerShell)

```
Alternatively, you can manually copy and paste the API key inside the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Set your IP manually in \static\app.js on line 7:

const LOCALHOST_IP = "127.0.0.1"; // Adjust based on your network
